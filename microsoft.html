                    <p>An Active Directory domain is a collection of objects within a Microsoft Active Directory network.</p>
                    <p>An object can be a single user, a group or it can be a hardware component, such as a computer or printer.</p>
                    <p>Each domain holds a database containing object identity information.</p>
                    <p>The main service in AD is Domain Services (AD DS), which stores directory information and handles the interaction of the user with the domain.</p>
                    <p>AD DS verifies access when a user signs into a device or attempts to connect to a server over a network.</p>

"Active Directory 007
How would you add a user or computer to a group within Active Directory?"	"Search or browse to the user or computer object
1. With the user/computer objects, select Member Of, then Add.  Search for the Group you would like to add the object to.

Search or browse to the group object:
2. With a Group object, select Members, then Add.  Either, search for the User/Computer object you would like to add, or enter the object manually."
"Active Directory 008
What containers are you able to place objects into within Active Directory?"	"Domain
Organisational Units (OUs)"
"Active Directory 009
How do you determine your current logon server within Windows?
Which is the most accurate and why?"	"From Start, then RUN: %logonserver%
From Command Prompt: echo %logonserver%
From Command Prompt: gpresult /r | findstr domain.com
From Command Prompt: set or set log or set Logonserver or set | findstr LOGONSERVER*
(any of the above will do, but if they suggest anything other than just 'set', this demonstrates the ability to identify the required information)
From Command Prompt: nltest /sc_query:domain.com
(nltest /sc_query is the most accurate as it queries your last secure channel to a domain controller.)"
"Active Directory 010
What is the principle of least privilege (POLP) model and how does it apply to Windows' accounts"	"The principle of least privilege (POLP) is the practice of limiting access to the minimal level that will allow normal functioning.
You should separate accounts based upon access level. (i.e. user account, service account, elevated account, domain admin account)."
"Active Directory 011
What is the SYSVOL folder and what does it contain?"	"The SYSVOL folder is a shared directory located on a domain controller(s) that contains the domain’s public files.

This are Group Policies configuration files, Software installation and Scripts files.
You can use it to store other files, but it is not recommended or supported as we have DFS and Windows Shares for file storage."
"Active Directory 012
What is DFS?"	"* Distributed File System (DFS) is a set of client and server services that allow an organization using Microsoft Windows servers to organise many distributed file shares into a distributed file system.

* DFS has two components to its service: Location transparency (via the namespace component) and Redundancy (via the file replication component).

* Together, these components improve data availability in the case of failure or heavy load by allowing shares in the same or multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, the ""DFS root"". This makes it possible to give users a virtual view of shared folders, where a single path leads to files located on multiple servers."
"Active Directory 013
What is a DFS Folder Target?
Can there be multiple Folder Targets and what is the effect?"	"A folder target is the UNC path of a shared folder or another namespace that is associated with a folder in a namespace.

The folder target is where data and content is stored.

More folder targets can be associated the folder target and with these additional folder targets, it increases its availability in case of failure of one or more UNC paths and also can provide access to the nearest path based upon the Active Directory Site.

A user who browses to, i.e. \\domain-name\Public\Documents is transparently redirected to the shared folder, i.e. \\SITE01-SVR-01\Documentsor, i.e. \\SITE02-SVR-02\Documents, depending on which site the user is currently located in."
"Exchange 001
What is an Outlook OST File?"	"Offline Outlook Data File (.ost)

The following is stored in the ost-file:
* Your mailbox data (mail, calendar, contacts, tasks, notes and journal folders).
* Public Folder Favourites.
* Shared folders of additional mailboxes linked to your Exchange account."
"Exchange 002
What is an Outlook PST File?"	"An Outlook Data File (.pst)
It contains  your messages and other Outlook items which are stored locally.
Can be used to provide archived and/or back up of your mailbox, which can be stored locally or remotely.

The following is stored in the pst-file:
* Emails
* Calendars
* Contacts
* Tasks
* Notes"
"File System 001
What is the advantage of NTFS over FAT32?"	"* NTFS was build for better performance, especially when it comes to managing the way files are stored and retrieved.
* NTFS supports encryption
*NTFS supports compression
* NTFS supports improved metadata support.
* NTFS is more robust, secure and has better utilization of hard drive space.
* NTFS is Fault Tolerance an can automatically repair files/folders in the case of power failures or errors. FAT32 maintains two different copies of the FAT in the case of damage.
* NTFS Supports long file name of up to 255 characters
* NTFS support file and folder permissions, while FAT32 only supports folder permissions, does not support file permissions
* NTFS allows Partitions up to 256TB, and single files of 256TB
* FAT32 allows partitions max of 32GB, single files up to 4GB"
"Group Policy 001
What is a Group Policy?"	"Group Policy is a feature of Microsoft Windows Active Directory that adds additional controls to user and computer accounts.

Group Policies provide centralised management and configuration of computer and user accounts within a Microsoft Active Directory Domain environment.

Group Policy allows the application of policies to be deployed domain-wide or to an individual set of user and computer accounts. OU's, WMI Filter and Security Groups can all be used to allow policies to only be deployed to the correct set of user and computer accounts."
"Group Policy 002
How do you force a refresh to your group policy on a Windows client?"	"Reboot the client device will allow the device to pick updated policies on next boot.
It can be force using the following command: gpupdate /force"
"Group Policy 003
Name one or more way(s) to display the group policies applied to a given client user and/or computer account?"	"Within Group Policy Management Tool using Group Policy Results

Within Group Policy Management Tool using Group Policy Modelling

Ping is used to troubleshoot Network/Internet connections.
Ping offers two primary objectives which are:
* To check if the host is available.
* To measure how long the response will take.

Can be used to determine other issues within a network like:
* The size of the data packet (MTU) that can be sent from source to destination.

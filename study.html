                <h5>OSI Model</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>7 - Application layer.  Applications like FTP, web browsers, DNS, SNMP etc live here.  Network services are requested here to be translated downstream over a network.</li>
                    <li>6 - Presentation layer.  Data representation and code formatting to ensure common format is used for sender and receiver to understand. Provides translation of data between the application and network layer. Can include protocols such as SSL/TLS for encryption.</li>
                    <li>5 - Session layer.  Establishes and manages the connections between networked computers/devices. For example, this layer is responsible for closing a session handled by TCP.</li>
                    <li>4 - Transport layer. Ensures reliable transmission of data segments.  Assembly/disassembly of data (segmentation/desegmentation), error control and flow control to control link reliability. TCP, UDP are protocols at this layer.</li>
                    <li>3 - Networking.  This is where routing takes place between different networks - each network has an address and this describes the process of routing packets from one node to another. Routing protocols, BGP, OSPF, RIP etc.  Structure, logical addressing implemented here. NAT, HSRP, ICMP handled here.</li>
                    <li>2 - Data Link layer.  Node-to-node data transfer. MAC (Media Access Control) and LLC (Logical Link Control) for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ZigBee. Also PPP (Point-to-point protocol).  Flow control and data transmission reliability is defined here as well (CRC added to the frame). Switches work on this layer. ARP at this layer.</li>
                    <li>1 - Physical layer. This is where the physical and electrical specifications are defined. Responsible for conversion of digital data into optical/electrical signals. Also include specification of pin layout, signal timing cable specs etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Importance</h5>
                <p>It establishes a prescribed guideline for interoperability between the various vendors developing products that perform different data communications tasks.</p>
                
                <h5>Network Troubleshooting</h5>
                <p>Talk sensibly about how they would troubleshoot network issues, ideally based upon examples. I.E. "First I would check to ensure there were no cable faults....." and so on. Talking about encapsulation etc at this point is positive. Trying to get a feel for their thought processes in this area.</p>

                <p>A device that filters and forwards frames between LAN segments. Separate collision domain for each port - i.e. each port can transfer data  without interference/collisions. *Collision domain*</p>
                <p>Multiple VLAN's can be configured on a switch - separate broadcast domains per VLAN. Without VLAN configured a single broadcast domain.</p>
                <p>Switches can be interconnected via a crossover cable. Often switches have RJ45 ports but also SFP ports allowing different media to be used. Layer 3 specific features of a switch allow it to work like a router, Inter-VLAN routing and also routing protocols - depending on the switch or license.</p></td>

            <td class="answer"><h5>Wireless Controller & Access Points</h5>
                <p>A WLAN controller configures and manages light weight access points via the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP). These points allow wireless devices to connect to the network, used widely in building where a large area needs to be covered by the same wireless network allowing seamless client connectivity around the building.</p>
                <p>Access points can be used in a standalone configuration. WLC can be cloud based or physical device. Multiple WLC's can be used in a mobility group.</p></td>

                <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection oriented protocol while  oriented protocol. TCP establishes, maintains and segments a connection between two devices. Connection established via three way handshake SYN --> SYN-ACK --> ACK. Connection closed by FIN (Initiator) --> ACK (Receiver) --> FIN (Receiver) --> ACK(Initiator). Reliable as data resent if packets dropped, also sequences packets.</p>
                
                <h5>UDP</h5>
                <p>Protocols: TFTP, SNMP, DNS by default, NTP, RIP, OSPF
                User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol. UDP broadcasts data without no reliability of transmission. Checksum for data integrity. Used where error checking/correction is not required"</p></td>

            <td class="answer"><h5>VLAN on Enterprise Network</h5>
                <p>VLAN = Virtual Local Area Network</p>
                <p>Understand VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol), trunk links, routing between VLANs.</p> 
                
                <h5>VLAN</h5>
                <p>It is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). VLAN can be present over multiple switches (in different locations) in a network but still act like they are on the same LAN.</p>
                
                <h5>Trunk Links</h5>
                <p>IEEE 802.1Q or dot1q, networking standard defining VLAN tagging of ethernet frames. Used to allow multiple vlans to transit an interface to anther switch or router. Can prune vlans down particular trunks - switchport trunk allowed vlan {list}. Native VLAN is untagged, default vlan 1 but can be changed.</p>
                
                <h5>VTP - VLAN Trunking Protocol</h5>
                <p>VLAN Trunking Protocol. Cisco proprietary, Used to synchronize (add, delete, rename) VLANs across a layer 2 network. VTP Server where VLANs can be modified/created/deleted. VTP client synchronizes and forwards advertisements. A device in VTP transparent forwards advertisements only, VLANs are local. Each change increments revision number, need to make sure vlan database is clear when adding used switch to network to avoid higher revision number overwriting existing network with its stale configuration.</p> 
                
                <h5>VLAN Routing</h5>
                <p>Options include multiple routers with vlans on different interfaces, router with sub interfaces, L3 switch.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Configure VLAN on access interface to router. Define IP address on router for gateway.</li>
                    <li>Have a single router and define a sub-interface for each VLAN. On the router Gi0/1.200 for VLAN 200 for example. Enable dot1q encapsulation for the right vlan number. Define IP address. On switch define trunk with dot1q encapsulation.</li>
                    <li>L3 switch define a vlan interface on the switch with the IP address. Term for the interface is SVI = Switched Virtual Interface.</li>

            <td class="answer"><h5>Address Resolution Protocol</h5>
                <p>ARP is used to map MAC addresses (Data link - layer 2) to IP addresses (Network - layer 3)</p>
                <p>ARP tables used on devices help devices forward traffic to the correct L2 address.</p>
                <p>Proxy ARP is the name given when a node responds to an arp request on behalf of another node. This is commonly used to redirect traffic sent to one IP address to another system. Use of proxy arp could be a security vulnerability.</p></td>

                <p>If the resource cannot be located, then the query will be forwarded to the default gateway, which will attempt to retrieve the requested service.
                This is useful because it allows access to resources that are not within the same local network. (i.e. Access resources in a Data Centre, Internet & other networks within the same site).</p></td>

                <p>Describe the DHCP process including  its basic function and location in a network.</p>
                <p>What other options does DHCP offer?</p></td>
                <td class="answer"><h5>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h5>
                <p>DHCP allows for the dynamic assignment of IP addresses so that devices can talk to other networks. Without DHCP server either static IP configuration is needed or self assigned APIPA (wont be able to talk outside of subnet).</p>
                
                DHCP can be configured on standalone servers (dhcpd, dnsmasq, dibbler, Windows Servers etc etc). Can also be configured on networking devices such as Routers.
                
                UDP port number 67 is the destination port of a server, and UDP port number 68 is used by the client. DHCP Discover(Client) >> DHCP Offer(Server) >> DHCP REQUEST(Client) >> DHCP ACK(Server) >> probe for address (client) >> finalize lease(client). DHCP offer includes subnet/gateway/dns server/dhcp server ip's/lease time etc. Client address probe ensures no duplicate IP's on subnet from multiple DHCP servers.
                
                Options are additional parameters that a DHCP can send to the client. Including things such as NTP Server, hostname, domain name, tftp server, smtp server default ttl.
                
                It helps in managing a large number devices that require the use of IP’s, very easily.  IPAM (IP Address Management) is a tool that can help planning, tracking, and managing the IP Address spaces used in a network.</td>

                Describe the different mechanisms for a client to keep the same IP address on a network."	"DHCP Renew lease
                DHCP address renewed by client sending DHCPREQUEST and server confirming with DHCPACK. DHCPACK including new lease information and updated parameters. If not renewed client needs to start lease generation process again.
                
                DHCP Reservation
                DHCP server reserves an IP address for a client based off the clients MAC address. This DHCP only uses the IP for this device.
                
                Static IP address on a device
                Statically define the IP information for the device. Minimum IP/valid netmask. Gateway needed for communication to external network."

                The DHCP server is connected to VLAN 200. A client on VLAN 200 is able to get an IP address. A network administrator adds new VLAN for a new office area, VLAN 500. Clients on this VLAN are getting APIPA address, why could this be?"	"Answer could include other relevant topics but principal ideas listed below.
                
                DHCP Helper/DHCP Relay Agent
                DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP broadcast traffic to the DHCP server. External DHCP server leases address based off the relay agents IP address. Relay agent communicates with DHCP server via unicast, usually source/dest UDP 67. DHCP relay agent broadcasts DHCP server response back to the client.
                Cisco SVI uses ""ip helper-address"" command to define the DHCP server address for example
                
                ACL Issues
                If UDP port 67 and 68 is blocked by an ACL or firewall the client's DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPOFFER will be blocked. Need to ensure a specific allow statement (could be to DHCP server or defining UDP traffic on those ports etc) is defined in an ACL if this traffic is transiting the network with restrictive ACL's in operation."

                The DNS Server returns a IP Address to the client with the IP Address information for the requested service.
                
                DNS also provides functions that aid in the validation and security of a service that operators securely within a network or on the internet, by only permitting secure authorised updates to DNS records.

                A single virtual default gateway is assigned on all routers. Router with highest priority in a standby group will be the active router. A single interface MAC is used with HSRP by default 0000.0c07.ac**   (where ** is the HSRP group number in hex). Only active router is sending and receiving traffic. Uses multicast UDP 1985 for IPV4, 2029 for IPV6 for HSRP status traffic for the interface. When active is detected down, next highest priority router takes the traffic and becomes new active. HSRP reduces the  priority upon link down detections."

                What is BGP? How is the route metric defined?"	"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP peers are established by manual configuration and utilise TCP connections on port 179 to exchanges data. iBGP (Internal BGP) when two peers in the same AS, eBGP (External BGP) is when two peers are in a different AS. It is a Path-Vector Routing Protocol.
                
                It is the algorithm used to narrow down a set of routes down to the best path. [Details of the algorithm not needed but if known, its an excellent answer]
                1) Largest Weight (Cisco specific and specific to the local router in the config)
                2) Highest LOCAL_PREF  (Default is set to 100) - indication about which path has preference to leave an AS, this value is advertised.
                3) Routes aggregated via the network vs aggregate-address (prefer network (self installed) over aggregate-address)
                4) Shortest AS_PATH - As routes pass through AS, each AS is appended to the AS_PATH metric.
                5) Lowest Origin Type.  IGP over EGP over INCOMPLETE
                6) Prefer the path with the lowest MED. MED is a hint to external neighbours about the preferred path.
                7) Prefer eBGP (external BGP) over iBGP (internal BGP) paths
                8) Prefer the path within the autonomous system with the lowest IGP metric to the BGP next hop.

BGP is a Path-Vector Routing Protocol using Best Path Algorithm - requires great IT administrator intervention for configuration.
                "Routing 010
                What is meant by the term asymmetrical routing and is this a problem?"	Asymmetric routing occurs when traffic takes one route to the destination and is returned to the source via a different route. Not always an issue however if there are firewalls in this path connection state information is stored. Traffic is prevented from flowing from a lower to higher security domain on the other firewall as it has no state information present. Issues with NAT also.

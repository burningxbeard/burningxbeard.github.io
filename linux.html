What is sudo and why would you use it? 

How is sudo different from Su?

What is the default sudo configuration file location?

How would you add user Paul to the sudoers group using the command line?"	"*Sudo allows you to run a program as another user such as root. 
*Sudo is commonly used to allow admin rights to perform tasks that a standard user cannot such as creating folders or running programs that require root permissions. 
*Su switches you to another user typically root. 
*Default file location for the primary configuration file is /etc/sudoers
* sudo usermod -aG sudo Paul"

What is grep, egrep, or fgrep?
How would you use grep to find any occurrences of the name Paul in the file members.txt ?
How do we use grep to tell us how many occurrences of the name Paul are in the members.txt file ?"	"GREP searches for specific strings from standard input
A couple of examples of how the user could use the grep command:
grep paul members.txt  or cat members.txt | grep paul

The use of ""grep -c paul members.txt""  would give a count of the times this appears  in the file

What does the command split do?

-Can you explain the following:
You have a file named fourty.txt that contains forty lines of text, How would you use the split command to split the file into four separate files appended ""split40"" ?

What does the command sort command do?

Which argument used with sort would be used to sort contents of a file in numerical order?"	"Split allows you to divide a large file into smaller chunks 

split -l 10 fourty.txt split40  - This would split the main file into four files with ten lines each in them.
The files would be named:
split40aa
split40ab
split40ac
split40ad

*The sort utility sorts a files data, it doesn't alter the files content just the output 

*Using sort with the -n argument will order the content in numerical order

Linux uses a three tiered approach to protecting files and directories
Can you name these them ?

You issue a ""ls -l"" command and get the following output :
-rwxrw-r 1 John sales 479 Jan 19 15:37 reserach.txt

Can you explain the permissions this file has allocated ?

What command can be used to change the owner of this file?

What command can be used to change the files group ownership? 

"	"The three tiers are:
-Owner: Each file and directory is assigned to a single owner
-Group: The files and directories are assigned to a single group of users, this group can be assigned specific privileges to the file or directory that differ from the owner privileges.
-Others: This category is permissions assigned to accounts that are neither the file owner nor the assigned user group.

The file has the following permissions set:
-First column (Owner) has read write and execute permissions
-Second Column (Group) has read and write permissions.
-Third Column (Others) has read only.
Owner is John, Group is sales 

chown - The command chown, an abbreviation of change owner, is used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems to change the owner of file system files, directories. 

chgrp - The command chgrp, an abbreviation of change group is used to change the group ownership on the file."
"File system 001
Name some default Linux directories and their uses"	"/ --> The top level directory in your system. It's called the root directory, because it's the root of the system.
/bin  --> Binaries. Commands needed during bootup that might be needed by normal users.
/boot  --> Files used by the bootstrap loader, LILO.  Kernel images are often kept here
/dev  --> Device files for devices such as disk drives, serial ports, etc
/etc  --> Configuration files specific to the machine.
/home   --> User's home directories.
/lib  --> Shared libraries needed by the programs on the root file system.
/lost+found --> Recovered Files from system crash that may be corrupt.
/media --> Subdirectories where removable media devices inserted into the computer are mounted.
/mnt  -->  Mount points for temporary mounts by the system administrator.
/opt --> Optional software that you installed.
/proc  --> This file system is not on a disk.  Exists in the kernels imagination (virtual).  This directory Holds information about kernel parameters and system configuration.
/root --> The home directory of the root user.
/run --> Application State Files
/sbin  --> Like bin but commands are not intended for normal users.  Commands run by LINUX.
/srv --> Service Data. Data for services provided by the system.
/tmp  --> Temporary files.  Programs running after bootup should use /var/tmp. Periodically cleaned.
/usr  --> Contains all commands, libraries, man pages, games and static files for normal operation.
/var  -->  Contains files that change for mail, news, printers log files, man pages, temp files."

Can you name any Linux Filesystems?"	"brts - newer high-performance file system. Can perform its own form of RAID as well as Logical Volume Management

ecrypytfs- Enterprise Cryptographic Filesystem applies a POSIX(Portable Operating System Interface) compliant encryption protocol to data before storing it on the device. This provides an additional layer of security for data stored on the device.

ext3 -supports files up to '2TiB' with a total file system of 16TiB. Supports journaling as well as faster start up and recovery.

ext4 - Similar to ext3 except it supports the total file system of 1 EiB and utilizes improved performance features. It is also the current version of the original Linux file system.

reiserFS - Created before ext3fs and commonly used on older systems

swap - The swap filesystem allows you to create virtual memory for your system using space on your physical disk."

What does the mount command do?

What does the tool mkfs allow us to do?

What raw device file would Linux create for the second SCSI drive connected to the system?

Which file does Linux use to indicate which drive devices should be mounted to the virtual directory at boot time?
-is this the best way to mount a temporary device?
-if a device detailed in this file is removed and the file not altered to reference the change what will happen at the next boot up?
 "	"*Without any parameters the ""mount"" command displays all devices currently mounted on the Linux system.
It is used also to mount a filesystem to the Linux virtual directory 
(mount -f fstype device mountpoint)

*The mkfs program is actually a front end to several individual tools for creating specific file systems 

*Linux creates files named sdx in the /dev directory for SCSI devices. For the second SCSI device , Linux would create the file /dev/sdb

*/etc/fstab - Is referenced by Linux to determine which devices should be mounted at boot time.

*No, use the mount command for temporary use of devices, editing the fstab file Is a more long term solution and requires the device to be present at each boot up.

"Network 001
What service is used to translate domain names to IP addresses? 

host - what does this command do?

dig - what does this command do ?
-How can you use dig to help determine if there is an issue with your dns server?"	"*DNS - On most Linux operating systems, the DNS servers that the system uses for name resolution are defined in the /etc/resolv.conf file. That file should contain at least one nameserver line. Each nameserver line defines a DNS server. The name servers are prioritized in the order the system finds them in the file
*The ""host"" command queries the DNS server to determine the ip addresses assigned to the specified host name.

*The ""dig"" command queries the DNS server to determine the ip addresses assigned to the specified host name.
*The dig command also allows you to specify a different DNS server which is a handy way of determine whether your default DNS server is at fault if a name resolution fails.

*The command would display ""testing""

*This type of variable is a local variable 

A local variable ""test"" is created and given the value of ""testing""
this is echoed to the terminal.
The ""export"" command is ran against the local variable ""test"". This converts the local variable to a global variable.
The ""bash"" command spawns a child process.
The now Global variable of ""test"" is echoed to the terminal to prove the export command converted the variable from a local to global variable."
